<p><span style="text-size: 30px">G</span>etting the busy and rapid crossroads</p>

<p>Seeing the busy and rapid people stream</p>

<p>They move fastly across the road</p>

<p>Nobody take his concentrate into me</p>

<p>Maybe I just a fool</p>

<p>To wanna get the dream but the reality is cruel</p>

<p>I take my plan into the row</p>

<p>And imagine beatifully I can get the grown</p>

<p>For what I couldn't</p>

<p>The world makes me get the crime</p>

<p>And punish me becoming Fragile, sensitive with a low self-esteem</p>

<p>May be I just can't</p>

<p>After all I am childish</p>

<p>All the people say I can't</p>

<p>I gradully agree with it with the time's going by</p>

<p>How many benifits I have get?</p>

<p>I never need judgement from those who failed</p>

<p>Never, never, forever!</p>

<p>So</p>

<p>Fuck the sarcasm</p>

<p>Fuck the weird</p>

<p>Fuck the evil and motherfucking world</p>

<p>They don't need judge me</p>
